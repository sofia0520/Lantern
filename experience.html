I've experience as one of the SISPA members. SISPA is a shortened word from Siswa Siswi Pertahanan Awam. It teachs me how to save many lives using various teqhniques such as Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation(CPR), Basic Life Support, Flood Preparations, how to handle natural disaster, and many more. Thanks to this, I'm able to help many people with my other comarades. Seeing the peoples' smile is also a gift in itself.</p>

I've also experience in blending in the working environment. This is because i've finished my internship at the Perbadanan Perpustakaan Awam Kelantan (PPAK). PPAK is a Kelantan Library that has been around for as long as i remember. It was always filled with many users going in and out to read and use the library's facilities. I work there in various departments like Literation, Kelantan Collection, Registration, and Catalogue. I learnt about how to deal with users, high dicipline, time-management, record and data managemnet and so on.</p>

Aside from internship and curricular, i've also have experience as a Diploma student of Information Management. This course have given me a lot of oppurtinies to express my creativity in bussinees dealer and managing informations. For instance, i've learnt to manage bussiness and create my own product using the right procedure. I've also learnt to be more confident in speaking because of a lot of presentations. Of course, this course also teach me about the basic of IT knowledges. Thanks to it, i can now create my own websites and will try to improve more in the future.</p>
